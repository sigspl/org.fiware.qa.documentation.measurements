By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the available deployment methods are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi do the following actions:\n \n Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (http://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fiware.org) \n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name  MiWi-POI server \n Fill in the \"Instance Name\" and select \"Flavor\" (this should be at least the \"m1.small\" memory model) and press \"Next\" \n Select a Keypair you have created earlier under the Security/Keypairs tab and remember to tick the \"default\" security group and press \"Next\" \n Press \"Next\" and then \"Launch instance\" \n \nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GE will appear in the \"Instances\" area. Remember to open the ports 80, 8080 and 22 at least  for the \"default\" group if not yet done so using the \"Edit Rules/Add Rule\" action (e.g. From Port 80 To Port 80) in the \"Security Groups\" tab of the \"Security\" page.  If you want to access your server externally you need to \"allocate a new IP to your Project\" and \"associate this IP\" with the server instance you just created above using the \"Actions\" \u2013menu available under the \"Floating IPs\" tab. See FIWARE Cloud Portal guide or refer to the Help&Info section for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Lab.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation.\n Using a Docker container \nA Docker container can be used to run your own instance.
